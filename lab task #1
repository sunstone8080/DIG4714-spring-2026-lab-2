- variables:
  int rowCols
  int playerTurn
  int outcome
  int turn


- method to create board (parameter rowCols, returns board)
  declare 2D char list board, rowCol cols
  for i<rowCols; i++ {
    board[i] = declare row list
    for j<rowCols; j++ {
      board[i][j] = " "
    }
  }
  return board


- method to check winner (parameter board, returns 0 or 1)
  check horizontal spaces for value x/o (rowCol times)

  check vertical spaces for value x/o (rowCol times)

  check diagonal spaces for value x/o (2 times)



- main() {
  take input for int rowCols
  char** board = createBoard(rowCols)

  int playerTurn = 1;
  int turn = 1;

  while outcome != 1 {
    if turn > 9
      if (call winnerCheck method) = 0 print "tied game" and return 0 to end main

    print "player [playerTurn]'s turn"
    take input for row
    take input for col

    check if that spot is taken
      if it's taken print "taken; try again" and do nothing else so loop restarts
    else check the playerturn
      playerTurn 1: place "x" in the corresponding spot
      playerTurn 2: place "o" in the corresponding spot

    call winnerCheck method, if it returns 1 the while loop will end

    player = player%2 + 1
    turn++
  }

  print "winner player [playerTurn]"
}
